I joined the Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) team as a Software Developer for the team's Autopilot Systems. We participated in the [AUVSI Student UAS Competition](http://www.auvsi-suas.org/), placing 4<sup>th</sup> in 2012 and 6<sup>th</sup> in 2013.

We also developed a Next-Gen Urban UAV with sponsorship and mentorship from Lockheed Martin Aeronautics. The team was responsible for all phases of the project starting from the conceptual design all the way through to the fabrication and flight testing.

I worked on the simulation and tuning of our autopilot, development of path-planning protocols, systems integration of the avionics, and the creation of a portable ground station. You can watch the video below to get a feel for the team's brilliant work.
