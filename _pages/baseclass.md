During the summmer of 2012 I interned as a Software Developer at <a href="http://www.baseclass-automation.com/index.php/en/" target="_blank">baseClass Automation</a> in Budapest, Hungary. I worked on developing <a href="http://www.monitoringsuite.com/" target="_blank">Robot Monitoring Suite</a>, a remote desktop software for industrial manipulators. It can connect to the robots over LAN or Wi-Fi, and lets a user control the manipulator by replicating the teach pendant on the remote computer.
