During the summer of 2014, I worked as a Research Associate under the supervision of [Prof. Michael Goodrich](https://faculty.cs.byu.edu/~mike/) at the [Human Centered Machine Intelligence Lab](https://cswiki.cs.byu.edu/hcmi/start) at Brigham Young University. The aim of this research was to increase the efficiency of a robot swarm tracking a pollutant in a fluid by intelligently utilizing the input from a human ally. We used a collective memory based swarm model. The fluid dynamics were simulated using the Navier-Stokes equations.

The video below is a demo of the simulation I created. In order, it shows the underlying velocity field, the robot swarm localizing over the flowing density, the same situation with obstacles in the field, and the swarm's real time response once the obstacles are removed. The green line is the swarm's center of mass.
