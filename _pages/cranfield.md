During the summer of 2013, I was a Visiting Research Student at Cranfield University, Shrivenham, England. My work there involved identifying and characterising the forensic artefacts that might be recoverable from a malicious Raspberry Pi device. For this purpose, I had to design a potential malicious device, and devise an experimental plan for its analysis. The presentation I gave to the students and faculty at Cranfield University is available <a href="/docs/cranfield.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
